The story shifts to a whodunit investigation amid suspects, motives, and shattered loyalties.

While she\'s away on a business trip to London, Charlie uncovers classified evidence that his superiors—including Deputy Director Alex Moore (Holt McCallany) and others—have covered up politically motivated drone strikes by disguising them as suicide bombings. Tragedy strikes when Sarah is killed in a terrorist hostage attack in London. Devastated and enraged, Charlie demands the CIA pursue her killers, but his bosses refuse to act due to geopolitical complications. Using the incriminating files he possesses (and help from contacts like field agent Jackson \"The Bear\" O\'Brien (Jon Bernthal) and anonymous source Inquiline (Caitríona Balfe)), Charlie blackmails the agency into training him as a field operative. Assigned a ruthless mentor, Robert Henderson (Laurence Fishburne), Charlie embarks on a globe-trotting revenge mission to hunt down the terrorists responsible. He leverages his tech-savvy intellect—hacking, surveillance, and clever traps—rather than brute force, turning into an unlikely, methodical avenger. As he closes in on his targets, the CIA turns on him, viewing him as a rogue liability and attempting to eliminate him. The film blends gritty espionage, emotional grief (exploring Charlie\'s trauma and denial-to-acceptance journey), and high-stakes action in a familiar revenge-thriller framework. Charlie\'s unconventional style and moral dilemmas make him a compelling anti-hero in an otherwise formulaic story of personal vengeance against systemic indifference.',	'James Hawes',	'Robert Littell &bull; Ken Nolan &bull; Gary Spinelli',	'Rami Malek &bull; Rachel Brosnahan &bull; Jon Bernthal',	'movie8.jpg'),

The narrative explores the heavy burden of a gangster\'s life, blending high-stakes action, drama, and Mani Ratnam\'s signature stylistic visuals. The film received mixed reviews—praised for performances (especially Haasan and Silambarasan), cinematography, and production values, but often criticized for a predictable or generic plot in the second half compared to Nayakan.

It\'s a complete entertainer for families and kids alike. A movie like this has arrived after a long time, and it\'s a delightful watch for all age groups. You walk out of the theatre excited, your mind buzzing with the story, eager to discuss the twists, the world-building, and the sheer creativity. It\'s the kind of movie that stays with you well after the credits roll.\r\nRated 10/10 - A magical ride worth every minute!',	'Padakkalam'),
(2,	'bruhbs',	'<b>Too late</b><br />\r\nVisuals : Overall good visuals but they were quite fascinating in some scenes. No scenes were foggy or too crowded, both lightning and camera work were good.\r\nSongs : except for the bgm in the last scene, songs (both bgms and sang songs) were just below average throughout the entire movie.\r\nPlot : Solid plot which could\'ve been presented in a much better way. Feels like it tried to be too complex, at the cost of lacking clarity. Plot twists seemed too redundant, the plot was constructing itself around a story only to getting ripped apart a few moments later. The spectator is caught up in a flux of continuous contradictory informations.\r\nI feel like if the plot had focused on a few key points, if it had set a clear context at the beginning and an epic/adventurous theme throughout the movie, it would\'ve been way more enjoyable.\r\nTLDR ; too complex for its own good, the movie is only watchable once. Really smooth visuals though.',	'Kingston'),

First half is the deadly ego clash between a veteran director Ayya (Samuthirakani) taking on the superstar KT Mahadevan (DQ) \'Nadippin Chakravarthy\' whom he discovered & mentored. Second half is pure Hitchcockian style murder mystery- who pulled the trigger? The way director has seamlessly blended both the parts together is what keeps you hooked till the end. What a solid performance by Dulquer Salmaan, his best till date, you can see the emotions of the character he plays in the breakdown \'mirror scene\'. And Samuthirakani as the ego driven maniac is perfect foil to DQ. Bhagyashri Borse is riveting and does a neat job as the girl torn between her loyalty to Ayya and her love for KTM. For Rana it is a cakewalk as comical investigation officer. Antony\'s editing and Jakes Bejoy bgm enhance the production. Yes it has pacing issues but is definitely one of the best films of the year, and is sure to sweep the awards.',	'Kaantha'),

The movie starts well and sets up the plot convincingly, but I do have issues with how the characters arrive at understanding the nuances. Well, let\'s give the makers some leeway for trying something different, and take it in the spirit of entertainment.\r\nIn spite of the decent start, it gets horribly confusing midway. At least to me it did. I know the swap-acting is super clever and all, but if you leave the crowd confused in the middle of an important scene, it defeats the purpose.\r\nSandeep Pradeep did a really good job, as did Sharaf U Dheen, who actually felt like he was breaking away from his usual style. I did not like Suraj in this one though. His performance felt off-key for the overall tone of the film.\r\nAll in all, it\'s a bold attempt to turn this thought into a film. But it drags and struggles for ideas toward the middle and the end. Once they got into it, the premise felt underused. The story had so much potential. It lacked intelligence, craft, and the screenplay was dull. Still, for what it tries to show, it did bring something new to the table.',	'Padakkalam'),

When his wife Sarah is killed in a terrorist attack in London and the CIA refuses to intervene, Charlie takes matters into his own hands. Being the genius puzzle solver he is, Charlie utilizes surveillance cameras and advanced technology to identify the four terrorists.\r\nCharlie discovers his Director, Alex Moore, to be a rogue agent, and blackmails him to give him special CIA training.

I cried like a baby, curled up in my seat. I saw him growing, I saw him losing himself, I saw him getting back to life. He once said in his songs, \"I started too young to give up\".

Abel Tesfaye wrote history for almost two decades. Now he played NO CHARACTER and that\'s why he was immaculate. I saw a kid that cried for help, I saw humility, I saw the grace of the Lord upon him.
